# CS-303 Assignment 1 README

Since I hardcoded the filename, please make sure that the file name matches. It's currently A1input.txt like the given input file.

Upon running the code, the user will be guided along to make the set changes in the program.

Question 1: "What number would you likke to search for?"
  User should enter whichever integer they want to search the file for. I used 14 in the example.

Question 2 & 3: "Which index would you like to modify?" | "What value would you like to override with?"
  User should input which index they would like to change. I used 79 in the example. 
  Then they are prompted for a value to overwrite in that given index. I used 159 in the example.

Question 4: "What number would you like to add to the end of the array?"

Question 5: "Would you like to print your array?" 
  This was a question added for testing and user ease. Answer 0 for no or 1 for true. This will also hold over to potentially reprint the array after removal step.
